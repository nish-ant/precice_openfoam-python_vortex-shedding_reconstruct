## Domain decomposition reduced-order modeling of incompressible flow
Zonal approach for coupling CFD simulation (OpenFOAM) and Galerkin-free ROM (Python) [[1]](#1) using preCICE [[2]](#2).

## Workflow
In order to perform the coupled simulation, the following order of directories must be followed:
1. `run.simulation_snapshots` - OpenFOAM case directory for data generation to be used in the subsequent steps.
2. `pod` - Performs snapshot POD on the snapshot data generated in the previous step.
3. `run.precice.overlap` - Contains the high- and low-fidelity components; performs the zonal coupled simulation.
Refer the README in each directory for more information.

## Simuation domain and subdomains for coupling
![domains](run.precice.overlap/images/Umag_t150_overlap-pointcloud.png)

**Figure**: The instantaneous velocity magnitude at $t=150$ obtained from the simulation in the case directory `run.simulation_snapshots` is shown in the background. 
The subdomains for the coupled simulation to be performed in the directory `run.precice.overlap` are also indicated.
The point cloud represents the sampling location of the snapshot data generation.
Refer [[1]](#1) for more information on subdomains.

NOTE: As shown in the figure, this case considers the low fidelity domains to be exactly same as the overlap domain, $\Omega_{LF} = \Omega_{O}$.
